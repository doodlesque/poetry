Lustful thoughts penetrate me

I wake up wet and wonder
Only of the side of your head
A soft buzz curves to a thick tuft of brown
Raven, like mine

Lonely is a word I could not work with
Now misery seeks joy in company
After a lifetime going stag
The masculinity consumes me

Your masculinity consumes me
In small glances
The hair on your arms contrast to mine
Your voice, unmistakably gruff

But I want you to remember the name
I want you to want to play games
I want you to reciprocate
You can’t say it’s nothing.

Does the loneliness makes me desperate?
Do I skip a prayer to make you come to me?
Do I pray you share your strawberries?
I know you’re a real man’s man.

A man that leaves women empty
A man that takes before the breath ends
A man that has no time for daylight
But I know that you know how to be soft.

So be soft with me.
