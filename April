Am I supposed to pray for dick?

I don’t let men penetrate me
So lustful thoughts penetrate me
I wake up wet and wonder
I had only thought of the side of your head
The soft buzz turned to a thick tuft of brown
Raven, like mine

Lonely is a word I could not work with
And now misery seeks company
After a lifetime going stag
The masculinity consumes me

Your masculinity consumes me
In small glances
The hair on your arms contrast to mine
The voice that is unmistakably gruff

But I want you to remember the name
I want you to want to play games
I want you to reciprocate
You can’t say it’s nothing.

I wonder if the loneliness makes me desperate
Do I skip a prayer to make you come to me
Do I pray you share your strawberries
I know you’re a real man’s man.

A man that leaves women empty
A man that takes before the breath ends
A man that has no time for daylight
But I know that you know how to be soft.

So be soft with me.
